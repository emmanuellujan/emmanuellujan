### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :mortar_board: Iâ€™m currently working at [Julia Lab](https://julia.mit.edu/) :muscle:, MIT, on the [CESMIX](https://computing.mit.edu/cesmix/) project. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on accelerating atomistic simulations through machine learning interatomic potentials, software composability, differentiable programming, and hpc.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with our growing atomistic suite: [AtomisticComposableWorkflows](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/AtomisticComposableWorkflows), [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl), [DFTK.jl](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/), [InteratomicPotentials.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/InteratomicPotentials.jl), [InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl),  [PotentialLearning.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/PotentialLearning.jl), [Atomistic.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/Atomistic.jl), and [LAMMPS.jl](https://cesmix-mit.github.io/LAMMPS.jl).
