### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :mortar_board: I work at [Julia Lab](https://julia.mit.edu/) :muscle:, MIT.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [CESMIX](https://computing.mit.edu/cesmix/) project, accelerating atomistic simulations through machine learning, software composability, differentiable programming, and high-performance computing.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with our growing atomistic suite, in particular you can take a look at [PotentialLearning.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/PotentialLearning.jl) and [InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl).
